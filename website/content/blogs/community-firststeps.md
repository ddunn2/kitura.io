Hi all,

The next step in transitioning Kitura to a community project, while not a
breaking change, is potentially a big one so I wanted to make sure everyone is
aware of what is happening.  Starting Saturday 12, 2020, I will begin migrating
active repositories from the IBM-Swift github organization to the Kitura
organization.

This will mean that your package references will change from
https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura to https://github.com/Kitura/Kitura .
GitHub will automatically redirect your requests from the old URL to the new
one.  So again, this should not be a breaking change.  However it will be good
for you to switch your URL pointers at some point in the future.

I will begin the transition with some less active repositories.  If all goes
well, I aim to end the migration with the actual `Kitura` repository within a
couple weeks.  This should give enough time anyone with problems to report
them.

On another front, a few people have chimmed in to help with the project.  While
we don't have a formal roadmap yet, here's a few things on the top of my mind:

 - Aim for NIO by default
 - To do this, we'll need to ensure unit tests are:
    + running successfully
    + updated to include new versions of swift and Xcode
 - Automate performance testing
 - Enhance Kuery-ORM for usability
 - Ensure we have good code quality management tools
 - We always need people to help with code reviews and documentation

If youâ€™re interested in helping to shape the future direction of Kitura, please
reach out! No role is too small or too big! Please follow-up on the
