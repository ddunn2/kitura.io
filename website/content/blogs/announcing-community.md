Hello Kitura community,

I’m delighted to announce that the IBM team who built Kitura are happy to aid
in transitioning Kitura to a community project. With their blessing, I’m proud
to be taking on the role as the community project maintainer. I’ll be working
with IBM over the next few weeks to work out the logistics in transferring
ownership of the project.

I know a lot of us have had questions about the future of Kitura. I’m glad to
help keep the project going and I’m looking forward to collaborating with
others who are passionate about server-side Swift. If you’re interested in
helping to shape the future direction of Kitura, please reach out! No role is
too small or too big! Please follow-up on the
[forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/kitura/31) in this group
or DM me on [swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/u/dannys42) or
[Slack](http://swift-at-ibm-slack.mybluemix.net/).

For all you Kitura users, hang in there. I hope to be reaching out soon to get
your perspectives on how you’re using Kitura and where you’d like to see
improvements. And of course the project will best be served by contributions
from all you lovely people out there, so get ready to send those pull-requests!

Thanks!

Danny
